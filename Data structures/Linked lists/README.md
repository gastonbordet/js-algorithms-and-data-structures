# What is a linked list?

Linked lists consists of nodes, in which one has a value and a pointer to another one or null. They don't have indexes, to access a specific node you have to go through every one until reach the desired one

# Properties of linked lists

head -> Is the beginning
Tail -> Is the end of the list  
Length -> Amount of elements

# Singly linked list

The terminology came from the fact that each node is only connected one directionally to the next node
