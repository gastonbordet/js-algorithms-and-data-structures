# What is a linked list?

Linked lists consists of nodes, in which one has a value and a pointer to another one or null. They don't have indexes, to access a specific node you have to go through every one until reach the desired one.

# Properties of linked lists

head -> Is the beginning
Tail -> Is the end of the list  
Length -> Amount of elements

# Singly linked list

The terminology came from the fact that each node is only connected one directionally to the next node.

Are good alternatives to arrays when you do insertion and deletion at the beginning.

# Doubly linked list

The difference with singly linked lists is that every node has another pointer to the previous node. This makes them more efficients than singly linked lists in operations which involves searching nodes.

# Stacks and Queues

Stacks are LIFO data structures. LIFO means that the last element added into the stack will be the first element to be removed.

Queues are FIFO data structures. Which means the first element added will be the first to be removed.
